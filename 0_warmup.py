# Week 6 Warmup

# Given: books.csv

# 1. Can you display a list of all of the book titles?



# 2. Can you display the list in alphabetical order?




# 3. Can you "title case" each title, so that each word in the title
#    starts with a capital letter and the rest of the word is lowercase?
#
#    Examples:  American Sniper
#               Being Mortal
#               Alan Turing: The Enigma
